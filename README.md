# FootballScoreTracker
The goal of App to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.


## MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

->The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.


->App is divided into two columns, one for each team.

->Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.

->Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:

->Each track a different kind of scoring

->The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.


## Functionality

->The code runs without errors.

->Each score button updates the score TextView in its column by adding the correct number of points.

->The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.
